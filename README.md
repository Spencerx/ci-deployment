# CI Deployment Scripts

This repo contains deployment scripts executed during project builds on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) and [Gitlab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/features/gitlab-ci-cd/)

The scripts should work across a number of repos that include a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yml` file within the `/rancher-config/` directory. They are intended to be included as a [Git submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) within the code repo.

Including this repo within your re (as detailed below) will:
* Build and tag the Docker image as detailed in the repo's `Dockerfile`. This happens on PR creation/update, tagging (including releases), and commits to the `master` branch
* Push the image to the appropriate docker repo (`nhsuk/$REPO_STUB`)
* If the build has been triggered by a PR a new stack will be created within the `nhsuk-dev` environment on the Rancher server based on the `docker-compose.yml` and `rancher-compose.yml` files found in the `rancher-config/` directory.
* If the build was triggered by a check-in to `master` a deployment will be made to the `nhsuk-dev` environment.
* A publicly accessible URL to the stack will be published as a comment on the PR.

## Setup in code repo

1. Add this repo as a submodule into a `scripts` directory of another repo (the target) using `git submodule add https://github.com/nhsuk/ci-deployment.git scripts/ci-deployment`.
2. Add a `docker-compose.yml` and optional `rancher-compose.yml` file to a `/rancher-config/` directory in your repo.
3. **(Travis only)** Update the target repo's `.travis.yml` to include the sections included within the example `.travis.yml` in this repo.
    - Setup Travis for the repo. Include all [environment variables](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Defining-Variables-in-Repository-Settings) not already available within the Travis environment (described below)
4. **(GitlabCI only)** Update the target repo's `.gitlab-ci.yml` to include the sections included with the example `.gitlab-ci.yml` in this repo.
    - Setup GitlabCI for the repo. Include all [environment variables](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Defining-Variables-in-Repository-Settings).

There is a [utility script](./configure-travis-env.sh) to set the non-Travis environment variables from the command line.
It assumes you have the Travis CLI installed and you are already logged into Travis.

## Environment variables

As the scripts are intended to be run within the Travis CI environment they use a number of environment variables available within that environment by default. The table below highlights those that are used along with additional ones that need to be added to the environment. Additional information about Travis environment variables can be found in the Travis [docs](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Default-Environment-Variables)

| Variable | Secret | Description | Default | Add to Travis? | Add to Gitlab CI? |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `VAULT_SERVER` | NO  | DNS name for vault server  | `vault.nhschoices.net` | YES | YES |
| `VAULT_TOKEN`  | YES | Token used to access Vault | | YES | YES |

There's a number of other environment variables, that are retrieved from the Vault, and need to be set

| Variable | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `DOCKER_USERNAME` | A username that has permissions to push images |
| `DOCKER_PASSWORD` | The password of the username |
| `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` | OAUTH token with [public repo access](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes), used to post comments to PRs |
| `SLACK_HOOK_URL` | Slack webhook URL for posting updates to |
| `SLACK_CHANNEL` | Slack channel to post update to |
| `RANCHER_ACCESS_KEY`  | The 'user name' part of the API credentials for Rancher access [Rancher API tokens](https://docs.rancher.com/rancher/v1.1/en/api/v1/api-keys/) |
| `RANCHER_SECRET_KEY` | The 'password' part of the API credentials for Rancher access [Rancher API tokens](https://docs.rancher.com/rancher/v1.1/en/api/v1/api-keys/) |
| `RANCHER_SERVER` | The URL of the Rancher environment |
| `RANCHER_ENVIRONMENT` | The environment which the application will get deployed to |

## Variable Precedence

Variables are loaded in a certain order, and if there are multiple variables defined with the same key, the last one defined takes precedence. The order of loading is as following:


| Order | Source | Used for? | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | TRAVIS/GITLABCI defined vars | Really only needed for VAULT variables or if Vault is unavailable | VAULT_TOKEN |
| 2 | CI Specific generated values (`$/gitlab/answers/10-defaults.sh` | Scripts in this repo, which generate answers from the variables generated by the CI (see [GitlabCI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/), [TravisCI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/) ) | `TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST=23`  becomes `DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG=pr-23` |
| 3 | VAULT (`defaults`) | common variables for all `nhsuk` applications | RANCHER_SERVER |
| 4 | VAULT (`$ENVIRONMENT/defaults`) | Deployment environment specfic variables | RANCHER_ENV, RANCHER_ACCESS_KEY |
| 5 | VAULT (`$APP_NAME/defaults`) | Variables that are common across all deployments of a single application | GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID |
| 6 | VAULT (`$ENVIRONMENT/$APP_NAME`) | Variables that are specific to an application AND an environment | DB_HOST, DB_PASS |
| 7 | Repo Specific Answers (`/scripts/answers/*`) | Runs all scripts in the application repos `answers` directory. Can be used to overwrite static variables for Review environments. | PR envs have custom `DB_NAME` |

### Finally

It is worth noting that it is possible to run the PR script locally by setting the environment variables. For example:

 `TRAVIS=true TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG=nhsuk/connecting-to-services TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST=<PR number of an image which still exists>  GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<personal access token> RANCHER_ENVIRONMENT=<rancher env name> ./deploy.sh`
